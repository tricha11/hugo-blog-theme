The mission of the Victimology and Victim Studies Research Lab (VVSRL) is to conduct high quality research related to crime victims and crime victimization, inform policy and practice, and help shape prevention and intervention efforts.

The VVSRL draws from undergraduate students engaged in UNO’s School of Criminology and Criminal Justice’s (SCCJ) victim studies concentration/minor and SCCJ’s masters and doctoral students and utilizes a structured mentoring model to develop future generations of victimology scholars. VVSRL student and faculty researchers have the opportunity to work across the Lab’s diverse portfolio of funded projects and future grant proposals promoting cross-teaching and learning and cultivating peer-to-peer mentorship.
