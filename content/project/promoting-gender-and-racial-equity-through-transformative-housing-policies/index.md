  Funded by a [Great Plains IDeA-CTR Team Development Pilot](https://gpctr.unmc.edu/funding/pilot-grants/) grant, this project examines the connections between domestic and intimate partner violence, eviction, and racial disparities in Omaha through the development of unique data including information on eviction and criminal justice system involvement. We aim to bring together partners from across governmental agencies, community-based non-profits, and mental health clinics to work holistically toward a data-driven, trauma-informed, restorative-justice approach to housing policies. Investigators include an inter-university and interdisciplinary team from UNOâ€™s Juvenile Justice Institute: [Anne Hobbs, J.D., Ph.D.,](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-public-affairs-and-community-service/juvenile-justice-institute/about-us/anne-hobbs.php) as well as criminology and criminal justice: [Tara Richards, Ph.D.](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-public-affairs-and-community-service/criminology-and-criminal-justice/about-us/tara-richards.php) (UNO), psychiatry: [Michelle Roley-Roberts, Ph.D.](https://medschool.creighton.edu/faculty-directory-profile/2897/michelle-roley-roberts) (Creighton University), and sociology: [Pierce Greenberg, Ph.D.](https://www.creighton.edu/faculty-directory-profile/1764/pierce-greenberg) (Creighton University). UNO SCCJ doctoral students, [Brian Gildea](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-public-affairs-and-community-service/criminology-and-criminal-justice/about-us/brian.gildea.php) and Michaela Goldsmith, serve as the graduate research assistants for the project.
