## Project Overview

<!--StartFragment-->

The proposed project includes a formative evaluation and evaluability assessment of a novel approach to DV intervention treatment in Seattle, Washington: The Domestic Violence Intervention Project (DVIP).  Specifically, the DVIP seeks to intervene on domestic violence through court-ordered batterer intervention treatment that relies on EBPs in treatment and supervision: the DVIP model uses a research-informed assessment of offenders’ risks and needs, an individualized treatment model, and supervision by a multi-disciplinary team that includes a treatment provider, probation officer, DVIP assessor, and a community-based and court-based victim-survivor advocate.  

While the DVIP is founded in EBPs, before determining whether the DVIP model is “effective,” we must determine how well it is being implemented and how evaluable it is. As such, in this formative evaluation and evaluability assessment we will examine: (1) the extent to which the program theory aligns with the program implemented, (2) the likelihood the program will produce positive results as currently applied, and (3) the feasibility of outcome evaluations as currently designed. Without a comprehensive understanding of program functioning, barriers, and areas in need of improvement, investment in a full outcome evaluation of the DVIP would be premature.   

The results of the proposed formative evaluation and evaluability assessment will provide actionable information for DVIP stakeholders on what is working well in the Seattle DVIP model, what needs improvement, and determine ideas for revision and enhancement. In addition, project deliverables will be instructive for other DV intervention treatment programs that are moving to integrate EBPs into their programming. The team will disseminate results through academic research articles, practitioner articles, and webinars, and will carefully document and archive all project data with the NACJD.
